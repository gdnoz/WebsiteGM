<p class="lead">
    My name is Guðni Matthíasson and this is my personal website.
    I am a computer engineer and cybersecurity professional from Iceland with a BSc in Computer Science from Reykjavík University and a MSc in Computer Science and Engineering from The Technical University of Denmark.
    <br/>
    I work as a security engineer for Syndis, where I perform application analysis, penetration testing and consultancy for a diverse group of customers.
    From 2014 to 2022 I worked on the design, development, maintenance, integration and support of enterprise systems, notably <i>Microsoft Dynamics AX</i>, <i>365 for Finance & Operations</i> and <i>Microsoft Power Platform</i>.
    Throughout my carreer I have actively explored various quality control strategies to improve the usability, reliability and security of my team's output as well as my own.
    <br/>
    On a more personal note: I play the guitar and sing a bit. I enjoy board games, beer, scuba diving, hiking, traveling and all things science.
    In short, I am a huge nerd.
    <br/>
    On this site you can find my CV and some of my private projects.
